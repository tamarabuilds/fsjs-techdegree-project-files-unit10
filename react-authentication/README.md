Hi there ðŸ‘‹. Here's a little documentation to help you better understand our project file structure.

<br>

# "START-HERE" Folder
## <u>What is this folder?</u>
This folder contains the starting project files for the course. This is where you will code along with the instructor throughout the course

## <u>When should I use this folder?</u>
When the video instructs you to download the project files and open them in your favorite text editor. Open the folder **inside** the "START HERE" folder.

<br>

# "project-files-by-video" Folder
## <u>What is this folder?</u>
This folder containing snapshots of the instructor's project files at the beginning and end of each video.

## <u>When should I use this folder?</u>
Some uses for this folder:
* If you decided not to code along at the beginning of the course but want to code along later on in the course.
* You want to see how the project files should look like at the end or beginning of a video.
* If you have a bug in your code and want to compare your code with the instructor's code.

## <u>How navigate this folder?</u>
When you open up this folder you should see a list of folders named after each stage (if the course has stages) or content (video, instruction, etc.). 

To find the project files for a specific video. 
1. If the course has stages: navigate into the folder that matches the stage name the video is in. 
2. Then navigate into the folder that matches that videos name. 
3. In that folder there should be a "BEGIN" and an "END" folder. The "BEGIN" folder contains the project files exactly how they are at the beginning of that video. And the "END" folder contains the project files exactly how they are at the end of that video. 

If you then want to start coding along later on in the course, I recommend emptying out the "START HERE" folder and pasting in the project file folder (in the "BEGIN" folder) from the respective video you are starting to code along in.
